  { I: UserCheck, t: "The person matters more than the app", b: "Anyone who walks into your home is met in person and verified first. For now, that person is one of us." },
  { I: ShieldCheck, t: "We fix what we damage", b: "If we break something while we are inside, we repair or replace it at our cost — no argument about whose fault it was." },

const story = [
  { t: "A house nobody walked through", b: "Raj's family home is outside the city. With work and the house to run, a free weekend to go and check on it never came. Months passed, and a house nobody walks through goes bad slowly — in exactly the way that costs a lot to undo." },
  { t: "The obvious fixes didn't work", b: "Every trip found something waiting, and paid for it twice: once to get there, once to repair it. Renting it out was meant to keep it alive — but the tenants didn't look after it either, and the rent came late, or not at all." },
  { t: "The call", b: "Raj researched it until he was sure, then took it to Naitik. Three sentences in, Naitik already knew how the story ended — his family had lived it too: a shut house, a kind “sab theek hai”, and a bill months later for something that was small in March." },
  { t: "Deciding what to build", b: "Not just an app. Software can be copied in a weekend; a verified person who actually turns up at your door, on the day they said, cannot. The app is there to carry the proof that person brings back." },
  { t: "Doing it ourselves first", b: "Before handing the job to anyone, we do the visits ourselves — to learn it properly, and to know exactly what we are asking of every inspector who joins after us." },
  { t: "Where we are today", b: "Live in Bengaluru, for homes, plots and cars. The land and the car are here because Raj's father worried about both: a plot in the village he couldn't get to, and a car whose wiring the mice got to. Every service we offer is something our families have already paid for." },
