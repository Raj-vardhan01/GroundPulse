                <h2 id="guarantee-title" className="t-2 mt-3 max-w-[18ch]">We're asking you to let a stranger into your home.</h2>
                <div className="t-body mt-5 max-w-[52ch] space-y-3.5 text-[15.5px] leading-relaxed text-text-2">
                  <p>Between the two of us there's a house outside the city, a plot in a village, and a car parked in another state. Every one of them has cost our families money that a single honest look would have saved — and for years the only update either family got was somebody saying sab theek hai. Meant kindly, every time. Proof, not once.</p>
                  <p>So we know exactly what we're asking of you in return, and we don't take it lightly. A website with good words on it is not a reason to hand a stranger your keys. We wouldn't do it either.</p>
                  <p className="text-text">Which is why what we're building is narrow on purpose. One verified person, standing inside your property on a day you picked, producing evidence you can check yourself — the actual room, on video, with a time on it. Not an estimate, not a summary, not somebody's opinion. Get that one thing right in every city we open, and any owner anywhere should be able to know the truth about a place they can't reach, within the hour, without booking a flight and without taking anyone's word for it.</p>
                  <p className="text-text">Until we've earned that, here's our side of it in plain terms. Whoever walks in is verified, and gets in only after you confirm. Every room is on video, and you can watch it live. And if we damage something while we're in there, we fix it at our cost — not an argument about whose fault it was.</p>
                  <p className="text-text">If any of it doesn't happen exactly as written, the four promises on the right are what you hold us both to.</p>
