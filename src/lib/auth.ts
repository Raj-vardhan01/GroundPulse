/* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Phone-OTP sign-in.

   An owner is often abroad on a foreign SIM, so any country's mobile
   works (see lib/phone) and the session lives in an httpOnly cookie
   for 30 days — long, because the whole point is opening the app at
   11 PM in another country without hunting for a password.

   Codes are sent by SMS through Fast2SMS. On a laptop no SMS is sent —
   the code is returned to the caller and shown on screen, clearly
   marked — unless SMS_IN_DEV=1.
