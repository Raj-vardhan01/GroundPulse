/* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   How many jobs an inspector can hold, and what missing one costs.

   · Up to five claimed at once, only one under way — "on the way" or
     "on site" — at a time. A house is never half-walked for another.
   · Two at once until ₹1,500 of the deposit is in — enough to cover
     five no-shows at ₹250. An empty one covers none, so two is the most
     we risk on somebody new. The deposit keeps building to ₹5,000 after.
   · At most three on any one day, and never two in the same window:
     nobody can be in two places.
   · Handing a job back is free until 24 hours before its window opens.
     After that it costs ₹150 from the deposit.
   · Not turning up — the window closes with no check-in — costs ₹250,
     the job leaves them, and the owner may move or cancel it free, even
     on the day. Someone who pressed "on the way" gets 45 minutes past
     the window, so traffic is not a no-show. Two of those in 30 days
     pauses the inspector, and the rest of what they hold goes back on
     the board.
   · A deposit can go below zero; it is made good from the next jobs,
     half of each one's pay (see DEPOSIT in lib/payout).
   · Ops can take a deduction back — an accident, a hospital. A waived
     miss does not count towards a pause.

   Everything that writes runs inside `mutate`, on the store it is given.
