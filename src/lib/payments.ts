/* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   When money is due, and what paying it does.

   · Booking: 25% up front. The visit is not on anybody's board until it
     is paid — a booking nobody paid for is not a booking.
   · Report ready: the other 75%. Until then the owner sees the score and
     how much was flagged; the full report opens the moment it is paid.
   · A repair: paid in full when it is approved. Approving is paying.
   · The first inspection of the launch offer is free, so none of this
     applies to it — unless something paid was added to it.

   Everything here runs inside `mutate`, on the store it is given.
