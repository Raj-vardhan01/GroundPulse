   Yearly plans, as the owner lives them.

   A plan is four inspections a year, two refresh cleans, and on Care+
   two maintenance services and the repair cover. Before this file the
   app could sell a plan but never use one: booking the next visit sold
   the whole plan again and reset the year. Now every booking against a
   plan takes one of its inspections, and nothing is bought twice.
