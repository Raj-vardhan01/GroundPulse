   One price calculator, used by the booking screen to show the total
   live and by the server action that stores it. Two implementations
   would eventually disagree, and the number the owner saw has to be
   the number they are charged — the lines are saved on the visit
   exactly as they were shown.

   Every rate here comes from `pricing.ts`, `cleaning.ts` and
   `rooms.ts` — the same numbers the public pages print.
